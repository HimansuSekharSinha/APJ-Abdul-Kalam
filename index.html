        (/ˈæbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27 July
        2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician who served as the
        11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
        spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
        mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
        India's civilian space programme and military missile development
        efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
        work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
        technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
        and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
        first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5] Kalam was
        elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both
        the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian
        National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he
        returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
        after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards,
        including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. While
        delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
        Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July
        2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
        attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where
        he was buried with full state honours.[8]
